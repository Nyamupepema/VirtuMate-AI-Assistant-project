Here is a general step-by-step guide on how to bake a basic cake. \n\n### Ingredients for a Basic Vanilla Cake:\n\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar\n- 1 cup unsalted butter (softened)\n- 4 large eggs\n- 1 cup milk\n- 1 tablespoon baking powder\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n### Equipment Needed:\n- Mixing bowls\n- Electric mixer or whisk\n- Measuring cups and spoons\n- Cake pan (round, square, or rectangular)\n- Parchment paper (optional)\n- Cooling rack\n- Spatula\n- Oven\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n\n#### Step 1: Preheat the Oven\nPreheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). This allows the oven to reach the desired temperature by the time your batter is ready.\n\n#### Step 2: Prepare the Cake Pan\nGrease your cake pan with butter or non-stick cooking spray. For extra insurance against sticking, you can also line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and grease the parchment paper as well.\n\n#### Step 3: Mix Dry Ingredients\nIn a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Sifting helps to remove any lumps and aerates the flour, which makes the cake lighter.\n\n#### Step 4: Cream Butter and Sugar\nIn a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 3-5 minutes. The process of creaming incorporates air into the batter, which helps the cake rise.\n\n#### Step 5: Add Eggs and Vanilla\nAdd the eggs one at a time to the butter-sugar mixture, beating well after each addition. Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next one. Once all the eggs are added, mix in the vanilla extract.\n\n#### Step 6: Alternate Adding Dry Ingredients and Milk\nGradually add the dry ingredients to the butter-sugar-egg mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk in two parts. Start and end with the dry ingredients. For example, add one-third of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined, then add half of the milk and mix until just combined. Repeat until all the dry ingredients and milk are incorporated. Be careful not to overmix the batter once the flour is added, as this can make the cake tough.\n\n#### Step 7: Pour Batter into Pan\nPour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula to make it even.\n\n#### Step 8: Bake the Cake\nPlace the cake pan in the preheated oven and bake for 25-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. The baking time can vary depending on the size and depth of your cake pan, so keep an eye on it.\n\n#### Step 9: Cool the Cake\nOnce the cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. After that, turn the cake out onto a cooling rack to cool completely. If you used parchment paper, peel it off once the cake is out of the pan.\n\n#### Step 10: Frosting (Optional)\nOnce the cake is completely cool, you can frost it with your favorite frosting. Common options include buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or a simple dusting of powdered sugar.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature unless specified otherwise.\n- Do not open the oven door frequently while the cake is baking, as this can cause the cake to fall.\n- To check for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean or with a few crumbs (but no wet batter), the cake is done.\n\nThis is a basic vanilla cake recipe that you can customize by adding flavors such as chocolate (by adding cocoa powder), lemon (by adding lemon zest and juice), or other variations. Enjoy your baking!\n```\n",

Here is a general step-by-step guide on how to bake a basic vanilla cake. \n\n### Ingredients for a Basic Vanilla Cake:\n\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar\n- 1/2 cup unsalted butter (softened to room temperature)\n- 1 cup milk (room temperature)\n- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 3 large eggs (room temperature)\n\n### Equipment Needed:\n- Mixing bowls\n- Electric mixer or whisk\n- Measuring cups and spoons\n- 9-inch round cake pan (or a similar size baking pan)\n- Parchment paper (optional, for lining the cake pan)\n- Spatula\n- Wire rack (for cooling)\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n\n#### Step 1: Preheat the Oven\n- Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). This allows the oven to reach the desired temperature by the time your batter is ready.\n\n#### Step 2: Prepare the Cake Pan\n- Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter or non-stick cooking spray. You can also line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper for easier removal of the cake after baking.\n\n#### Step 3: Mix Dry Ingredients\n- In a medium-sized bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Sifting helps to remove any lumps and aerates the flour, which makes the cake lighter. Set aside.\n\n#### Step 4: Cream Butter and Sugar\n- In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 3-5 minutes on medium speed. The process incorporates air into the batter, which helps the cake rise.\n\n#### Step 5: Add Eggs and Vanilla Extract\n- Add the eggs one at a time to the butter-sugar mixture, beating well after each addition until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and mix until combined.\n\n#### Step 6: Alternate Adding Dry Ingredients and Milk\n- Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter-sugar-egg mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk in two parts. Start and end with the dry ingredients. For example, add one-third of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined, then add half of the milk and mix until just combined.

The baking time may vary depending on your oven and the size of your cake pan. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs (but no wet batter).\n\n#### Step 9: Cool the Cake\n- Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. After that, run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cake, and then invert it onto a wire rack to cool completely. If you used parchment paper, peel it off once the cake is out of the pan.\n\n#### Step 10: Frost and Serve (Optional)\n- Once the cake is completely cool, you can frost it with your favorite frosting (such as buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or a simple dusting of powdered sugar). Slice and serve.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature unless specified otherwise. This helps them to mix together more evenly.\n- Do not open the oven door frequently while the cake is baking, as this can cause the cake to fall.\n- For a more moist cake, you can add a tablespoon of sour cream or yogurt to the batter.\n\nThis is a basic vanilla cake recipe that you can customize by adding flavors such as chocolate (by adding cocoa powder), lemon zest, or other extracts.
